lsmod | grep spi


If you see spi_bcm2835, then you can proceed 


If for some reason the SPI module has not activated, we can edit the boot configuration file
manually by running the following command on our Raspberry Pi.

sudo nano /boot/config.txt

Within the configuration file, use Ctrl + W to find “dtparam=spi=on“.

If you have found it, check to see if there is a 
in front of it. If there is, remove it as this is commenting out the activation line.
If you can’t find the line at all, add “dtparam=spi=on” to the bottom of the file


sudo pip3 install spidev

sudo pip3 install mfrc522

sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip
